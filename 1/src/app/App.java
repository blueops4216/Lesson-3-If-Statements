/* How Old Are You?
 * Make a program which displays a different message depending on the age given.
 * Here are the possible responses:
 * 
 * age is less than 16, say "You can't drive."
 * age is less than 18, say "You can't vote."
 * age is less than 25, say "You can't rent a car."
 * age is 25 or over, say "You can do anything that's legal."
 * 
 * Here's a sample run. Notice that a person who is under 16 will display three messages, one for being under 16, one for also being under 18, and one for also being under 25.
 * 
 * Hey, what's your name? Billy_Corgan
 * 
 * Ok, Billy_Corgan, how old are you? 17
 * 
 * You can't vote, Billy_Corgan.
 * You can't rent a car, Billy_Corgan.
